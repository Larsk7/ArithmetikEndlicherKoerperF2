implemented fuctions:
- represent binary tuple as Polynom
- add polynoms
- polynomdivision
- check for minimal polynom
- multiply polynoms and reduce with minimalpolynom (≙relation)
- Euclid´s algorithm for polynoms
- alternative implementation of polynom-multiplication
-> compare performance between the different implemations
